# Quick Start Deployment Guide

## 🚀 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: GitHub Repository Setup
```bash
# Create your permissions database repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/permissions-database.git
cd permissions-database

# Copy the architecture files
cp -r /path/to/this/solution/* .

# Commit the initial setup
git add .
git commit -m "Initial setup: GitHub-based service access system"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Configure Harness IDP
1. **Add GitHub Connector**:
   - Go to Harness → Connectors → New Connector → GitHub
   - Add your GitHub Personal Access Token
   - Test connection

2. **Import Workflow**:
   - Go to IDP → Workflows → Import
   - Point to your repository: `.harness/workflows/dynamic-service-access-workflow.yaml`

3. **Configure Secrets**:
   - Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret in Harness
   - Set repository variables: `GITHUB_ORG`, `GITHUB_REPO`

### Step 3: Test the System
1. Go to Harness IDP → Workflows
2. Select "Service Access Request"
3. Choose a user group → Services populate automatically
4. Select services → Get access token

## 🎯 Architecture Overview

The complete architecture provides:

### **Core Components**
- **GitHub Repository**: Acts as the database for user groups and services
- **Harness IDP**: Provides dynamic workflows and user interface
- **Dynamic Picker**: Real-time service filtering based on permissions
- **Audit Trail**: All access requests logged automatically

### **Data Flow**
1. User selects user group → Dynamic API call to GitHub
2. Services load based on permissions → JSONata filtering
3. User selects services → Permission validation
4. Access token generated → Audit log created in GitHub

### **Scalability Features**
- ✅ **Unlimited User Groups**: No hardcoded mappings
- ✅ **Dynamic Service Filtering**: Real-time permission matching
- ✅ **GitHub-native Storage**: Leverages Git version control
- ✅ **Zero External Dependencies**: Only GitHub + Harness

### **Security Architecture**
- **Authentication**: Harness IDP RBAC + GitHub token auth
- **Authorization**: Permission-based service access
- **Audit**: Complete trail in GitHub commits
- **Compliance**: SOX, PCI DSS, ISO 27001 ready

## 📊 Production Deployment Patterns

### Small Team (< 100 users)
```
Single Repository → Single Harness Project → Basic RBAC
```

### Enterprise (1000s of users)  
```
Multi-Repository → Multi-Org Harness → Advanced RBAC → Compliance
```

### Government/Regulated
```
Air-gapped → Custom Auth → Enhanced Audit → Compliance Controls
```

## 🔧 Customization Points

### Add User Groups
```json
// In permissions-data/user-groups.json
"new-team": {
  "name": "New Team", 
  "permissions": ["read", "write"]
}
```

### Add Services
```json
// In permissions-data/services-registry.json
"new-api": {
  "name": "New API",
  "requiredPermissions": ["read"]
}
```

### Modify Workflow
- Edit `.harness/workflows/dynamic-service-access-workflow.yaml`
- Customize JSONata expressions for filtering logic
- Add additional form fields or validation steps

## 📈 Monitoring & Operations

### Key Metrics
- User group access patterns
- Service request volumes  
- Token generation rates
- Permission denial reasons

### Operational Tasks
- Monitor GitHub API rate limits
- Review access logs regularly
- Update user groups as org changes
- Maintain service registry accuracy

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

1. **GitHub Token Management**:
   - Use fine-grained tokens
   - Rotate tokens regularly
   - Monitor token usage

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement least privilege
   - Regular access reviews
   - Automated deprovisioning

3. **Audit & Compliance**:
   - Regular log reviews
   - Compliance reporting
   - Incident response procedures

The architecture is designed to be enterprise-ready while maintaining simplicity for small teams. It scales automatically without code changes and provides complete audit trails for compliance requirements.
